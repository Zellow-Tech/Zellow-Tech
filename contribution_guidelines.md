# Join the development

* Before you join the development, please set up the project on your local machine, run it and go through the application completely. Press on any button you can find and see where it leads to. Explore! You'll be more familiar with what is where and might even get some cool ideas on how to improve various aspects of the app.
* If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.

## Contributing

When contributing to the repositories, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, or the official [Slack channel](https://zellow-tech.slack.com/).


## Contributions Best Practices

### Check before committing

You can save you sometime by running some checks locally before committing.


### Commits

* Write clear meaningful git commit messages. 
* Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged.
* When you make very, very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a failing build or some small style corrections or minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix.
* When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers, and you'll also get reviews quicker.
* Pleaes also add any other details that you think might be absolutely necessary, and if useful, how it affects the code, to a PR.

##### Structure of PR and actions
* feat : use this when a new feature is implemented.
* issue : use this action when you have to report an issue.
* update : use this action when you've updated some code in the existing file.
* create : use this action when you've added a new file to the code.

```
< action (file where the change is made or the part in the repo) > : < short description of the change made > < version of the app at the time >

example : feat(main.dart) : added dynamic page routing based on user status. 1.2.112
```


### Feature Requests and Bug Reports
